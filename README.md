# SamoApp
Integrated Pub Management Application

SamoApp is an application that aims to cover most of the aspect of managing an establishment like a bar or a pub.

## Documentation
SamoApp isn't yet documented. There is only a few Javadocs comments in the code, however, this will be fixed soon.

## Deployment
This application isn't currently provided in a packaged way, so you'll need to use Maven to package it. There is a goal named "package" that will build 2 jars, one of them containing all the references libraries, so you don't need to manually install dependencies.

After you execute the .jar package, open your web browser and go to https://<ip>:8800. This will get you into the Waiter Frontend, the first and only implemented part (at this time) of this project.

## Contributing
This project is intended to use a lot of different technologies (like Maven, Jetty, HSQLDB, JSON, HTML, etc...), because I'm learning how to manage them the right way, so feel free to improve and make as much pull requests as you want but, please, be patient, I need to understand what your are trying to do before make the pull effective. Consequently, please, be clear and concise in your requests.

Thanks in advance for any help you are able to provide.
